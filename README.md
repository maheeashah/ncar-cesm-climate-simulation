Climate simulation exercises using CESM and CISM models, extended with analysis and visualization.
# NCAR CESM Climate Simulation Exercises

This project contains climate simulation exercises completed using the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM) and Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM). Based on public tutorial exercises, I extended the workflow to perform additional data analysis and visualization.

## Key Activities
- Ran simplified climate-ice sheet coupled simulations using CISM Exercise 2 from the NCAR CESM-Tutorial.
- Analyzed surface height, temperature, and other model outputs.
- Visualized simulation results using Python libraries like Matplotlib and xarray.
- Explored cloud and HPC data workflows for scientific computing.

## Status
Ongoing extension of scientific computing workflows for climate simulation and analysis.
